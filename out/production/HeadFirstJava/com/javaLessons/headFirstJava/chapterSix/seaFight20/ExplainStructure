Version 2.0
Simple version - use only one line
sheep is represented as array of three cells
in bounds of seven possible cells to set the sheep
Standard array for the sheep altered into ArrayList<>
to simplify behaviour when you choose already chosen cell before
and for decreasing the capacity of the ArrayList to simplify examination if you already sank the sheep
